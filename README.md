# GoodEats
This is a full-stack Javascript application using MySQL, React, and ExpressJS that uses a custom-trained IBM Watson AI image-recognition model 
to identify and display nutritional data about users' uploaded food images.

## Brief
This is an mini ongoing project. The current features allows user to input food pictures and classify food images.(Sort of like Shazam for food)

## Video
Here is a short video demonstrating my project. Please feel free to comment on my youtube video for more suggestions, thanks!
